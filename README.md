# Veriff engine test task
**Running the solution**
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
Working on this challenge was a lot of fun for me. Having to develop following design and functionality concept was something I really appreciated.
I ran across various issues when working on the project. This was my first project in which I utilized Typescript. I started with a small mock in Javascript to explore how I might utilize test selectors, but it was not working that well with Unit Testing (with testing-library that I learned at Veriff workshop). I then moved on to Cypress to learn more about E2E testing. In any case, I'm truly sorry for not being able to get the tests to work, therefore I started working on the project to finish it before the deadline.
Looking back, it was not stressful, but rather a very delightful experience.
I took this assignment very seriously.
Technically, it did not appear to be a difficult task, so I utilized tools that I use on a daily basis.

I should have done the following:
* Create a single Check component rather than a group of them
* Testing (I had some cases, one of which was to test how the submit button works, but I didn't add them because the tests ran randomly and I didn't know how to solve it).
* Read my code more thoroughly and refactor it to make it more concise (do I need so many states? etc.).
* Event handlers should be more simple; they are far too lengthy and complicated for the purpose at hand.
* Check to see if the data provided by the API is valid and usable.
* Better error handling
* Submit data as JSON

Things that I did:
* React module CSS
* Nearly copy the style that the video showed
* Use react-query to wait for the fetching data
